We've been going through a growth spurt recently - we've grown the business 10x in the past 12 months. And we don't intend to stop here. There is a gargantuan opportunity for building financial services that consumers care about and that deliver beyond expectations. We've been growing largely thanks to word of mouth and our service is highly praised by its customers (see #URL_52759560942065fbfc367cadd21d665f03350d4b43b44b1c28df81a518d77dad#). Now we're busy scaling ourselves to become a global leader in the space.Why TransferWise? We're seeing that there's a huge opportunity to rebuild financial services. The level of service offered by banks is completely unsatisfactory. We started by re-building one very specific service where we saw an opportunity to make a change. While we still have a very long way to go with money transfer we do think there's much more to be done in financial services in general. We're a small, international and agile team with a goal of flipping a gazillion dollar industry on its head and taking power away from banks and the establishmentWe're looking for a an experienced leader to join us and help to build out our product function. You should have experience with transactional/ecommerce products in consumer space and be obsessed with customer experience and understanding customers. With a track record of building high performance teams that have launched products with lots of delighted users.TransferWise is revenue generating and well funded by Sir Richard Branson, Peter Thiel, IA and Index Ventures. We're a team of 100+ people today, growing every day.
